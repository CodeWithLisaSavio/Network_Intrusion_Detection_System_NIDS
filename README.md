Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) project applies a data-driven methodology using machine learning to detect and classify network intrusions. Network traffic data, stored in CSV format, is used for both training and testing in IBM watsonx.ai Studio. 
AutoAI automates model selection, tuning, and evaluation, ensuring optimal performance for real-time threat detection.
